      <h1>The Church - an exhortation to unity</h1>

<time datetime="2021-07-19">19 Jul 2021</time>

<p>I started this blog in 2019. I made two posts and then no more after that, Now that I have retired to the Philippines I'm praying that I will have more time to devote to this blog. Hopefully what I have to say will be of interest to someone and maybe help someone find the path they are meant to tread.</p>
<p>Psalm 133</p>
<p>Psa 133:1  A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!</p>
<p>Psa 133:2  It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes!</p>
<p>Psa 133:3  It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore.</p>
<p>Unity is a pressing need within the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ. Where there is unity there is strength. Jesus said a house divided against itself shall fall. Now unity and union are not the same. Unity: State of being one—as a body is one organism. Union: Act or instance of uniting two or more things into one organization.</p>
<ol>
<li>The church should have unity bwcause the Church is one - the body of Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 Corinthians 12:12-13</p>
<p>1Co 12:12  For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.<br>
1Co 12:13  For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:4-6</p>
<p>Eph 4:4  There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call—<br>
Eph 4:5  one Lord, one faith, one baptism,<br>
Eph 4:6  one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</p>
<p>Since the Church is one, if any member suffers, the whole body suffers.</p>
<pre><code>1 Corinthians 12:25-26

1Co 12:25  that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
1Co 12:26  If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.

The Church as a body can only function properly when all members are working together.

  1 Corinthians 12:20-24

  1Co 12:20  As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
  1Co 12:21  The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
  1Co 12:22  On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
  1Co 12:23  and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
  1Co 12:24  which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,

  2. The Church can have unity because of te abiding presence of the Holy Spirit.

  John 14:16-17

  Joh 14:16  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,
  Joh 14:17  even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.

  One thing to make note of here is that the Holy Spirit came when the Church was of one accord.

  Acts 2:1-4

  Act 2:1  When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
  Act 2:2  And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
  Act 2:3  And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.
  Act 2:4  And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

  And after He (the Holy Spirit) came see Acts 2:42-47

  Act 2:42  And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.
  Act 2:43  And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.
  Act 2:44  And all who believed were together and had all things in common.
  Act 2:45  And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.
  Act 2:46  And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,
  Act 2:47  praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.

  In John 17:20-21 Christ prayed that we have unity, God will surely answer is prayer.

  Joh 17:20  “I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,
  Joh 17:21  that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

  3. How can the Church maintain this unity.

  The Church can maintain this unity by faith. (Ephesians 3:14-17)

  Eph 3:14  For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
  Eph 3:15  from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
  Eph 3:16  that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
  Eph 3:17  so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…

  The Church can maintain this unity by abiding in Christ and obeying His Word. (John 15:7)

  Joh 15:7  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

  2 John 9

  2Jn 1:9  Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

  1 John 3:24

  1Jn 3:24  Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.

  The Church can maintain this unity by putting forth ab effot (Eph 4:1-3)

  Eph 4:1  I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called,
  Eph 4:2  with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
  Eph 4:3  eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

  4. What this unity will bring the Church.

  It will bring the church maturity (Ephesians 4:11-13).

  Eph 4:11  And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers,
  Eph 4:12  to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,
  Eph 4:13  until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
  Eph 4:14  so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.

  It will bring the Church stability (Ephesian 4:14).

  Eph 4:14  so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.

  It will bring the Church love for each other (Ephesian 4:15-16).

  Eph 4:15  Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,
  Eph 4:16  from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.

  It will bring the Church rejoicing (1 Corinthians 12:26).

  1Co 12:26  If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.

  It will bring the Church power (Acts 2:41;4-4;4:23-31).

  Act 2:41  So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.

  Act 4:4  But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.

  Act 4:23  When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
  Act 4:24  And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,
  Act 4:25  who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, “‘Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?
  Act 4:26  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed’—
  Act 4:27  for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
  Act 4:28  to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
  Act 4:29  And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,
  Act 4:30  while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”
  Act 4:31  And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
