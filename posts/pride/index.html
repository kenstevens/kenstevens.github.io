      <h1>Pride</h1>

<time datetime="2019-09-07">07 Sep 2019</time>

<p>Back at the close of he sixth century Pope Gregory classified all sins under seven distinct sins.<br>
These were pride, anger, envy, impurity, gluttony, slothfulness, and avarice. These became known<br>
as the Seven Deadly Sins. It is the first one on the list I wish to discuss today. It is Pride.</p>
<p>The question that faces us today is pride ever not a sin. For example, is pride<br>
in your children's accomplishments a sin. Read on, the answer may surprise you.</p>
<p>Refer to Proverbs 6:16-19</p>
<pre><code>  16¬†There are six things that the Lord hates,
  seven that are an abomination to him:
  17¬†haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
  and hands that shed innocent blood,
  18¬†a heart that devises wicked plans,
  feet that make haste to run to evil,
  19¬†a false witness who breathes out lies,
  and one who sows discord among brothers
</code></pre>
<p>As it says in verse 16, there are 6 things, then the author, under the<br>
inspiration of God, changes his mind and says 7 things that the Lord hates, no,<br>
wait, he says is an abomination to the Lord. On top of the list is haughty eyes.<br>
The lifting up of one‚Äôs eyelids expresses haughtiness and pride. Pride. That is<br>
on top of the list. At the very least God hates pride and at most he finds it an<br>
abomination.</p>
<p>Now let's refer to Proverbs 8:12-13</p>
<pre><code>  12¬†‚ÄúI, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
  and I find knowledge and discretion.
  13¬†The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
  Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
  and perverted speech I hate.
</code></pre>
<p>Pride and arrogance again He hates. He doesn't give an exception of pride that<br>
says its OK. Let's look at a few more verses.</p>
<p>Proverbs 21:3-4 says:</p>
<pre><code>  3¬†To do righteousness and justice
  is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
  4¬†Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
  the lamp of the wicked, are sin.
</code></pre>
<p>Haughty eyes and a Proud heart are sin. God does not mince words. He says,<br>
beyond a shadow of a doubt, it's sin.</p>
<p>Let's try a few verses from the New Testament. Mark 7:20-23;</p>
<p>20¬†And he said, ‚ÄúWhat comes out of a person is what defiles him.<br>
21¬†For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual<br>
immorality, theft, murder, adultery,<br>
22¬†coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.<br>
23¬†All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here, God calls pride an &quot;evil thing&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1 Perter 5:5</p>
<p>5¬†Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves,<br>
all of you, with humility toward one another, for ‚ÄúGod opposes the proud but<br>
gives grace to the humble.‚Äù</p>
<p>God opposes the proud, but He gives grace to the humble. So if you are proud God<br>
will oppose you. If you want to live under God's grace be humble.</p>
<p>God's word has many place where it calls pride a sin. It calls pride an<br>
abomination to the Lord. It gives no exceptions of pride being not a sin. So<br>
Pride in your children's accomplish is a sin, lest the child becomes prideful and<br>
boasts.</p>
<p>So, we should experience joy in accomplishments or their child's accomplishments, but never pride.</p>
<p>Let me close with this:</p>
