My name is Ken Stevens and I am a child of God. I have been many things during my life, a father, husband, Computer programmer, cab driver, etc. But mostly I identify as a child of God.

In this blog you will find mostly sermons or sermonettes, if you will. Occassionaly maybe a blog about what's currently going on in my life, but mostly the Word of God  you will find here.

Currently I have retired to the Philippines. I moved here in February of 2020. I am married to s beautiful Filipina and have two  beautiful dtep-daughters which I will be adoptng.
